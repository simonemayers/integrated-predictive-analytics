# Integrated Predictive Analytics in R

This project features R scripts that demonstrate the application of predictive analytics across multiple datasets, focusing on residential heating load, astronaut oxygen consumption during physical activities, and the prediction of drug interaction probabilities.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- **R**: You need R installed on your machine to run the script.

### Required R Packages:
- **readr**: For reading CSV files.
- **knitr**: For reporting features.
- **dplyr**: For data manipulation.
  - Install the necessary packages using R:
    ```R
    install.packages(c("readr", "knitr", "dplyr"))
    ```

### Execution
- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/integrated-predictive-analytics.git
  cd integrated-predictive-analytics
  ```
- Run the R script:
  ```bash
  Rscript predictive_analytics_suite.R
  ```

### File Structure
- `predictive_analytics_suite.R`: Main script file containing R code for analysis and predictive modeling across various datasets.

### Contributing
Contributions to enhance or extend the analysis are welcome. Please adhere to this simple workflow:
- Fork the repository.
- Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
- Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
- Open a pull request.

## üß© Project Purpose

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Residential Heating Load Prediction
- **Data Processing**: Loads and preprocesses building characteristics data.
- **Regression Analysis**: Uses a regression formula to predict heating load based on surface area, height, roof area, and glazing area.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Astronaut Oxygen Consumption Prediction
- **Data Setup**: Loads data capturing astronaut activity metrics.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applies regression models to predict oxygen consumption based on age and heart rate metrics.
- **Model Optimization**: Implements gradient descent to refine prediction accuracy by adjusting model weights based on error minimization.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Drug Interaction Probability Prediction
- **Data Processing**: Prepares data involving dosages and interaction metrics.
- **Logistic Regression**: Uses logistic regression to compute probabilities of dangerous drug interactions based on dosage combinations.
